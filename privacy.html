            <li><strong>Log Data:</strong> Our servers and content delivery networks (CDNs) automatically record
                information when you visit. This may include your IP address, browser type, device information, and
                timestamps.</li>
            <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us via email, we collect your email address and the
                content of your message to respond to your inquiry.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking:</strong> We may use essential cookies to ensure website functionality and
                security. We do not use third-party advertising cookies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To operate and maintain our digital infrastructure.</li>
            <li>To detect and prevent fraud, spam, and security incidents.</li>
            <li>To communicate with you regarding vendor partnerships, IP licensing, or administrative matters.</li>
            <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our agreements.</li>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We may share information in the following limited

                protect your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in the
                good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect our rights,
                or ensure the safety of others.</li>

        <p>We implement commercially reasonable security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized
            access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location (including residents of California and the EEA/UK), you may have certain rights
            regarding your personal information, such as the right to access, correct, or delete data we hold about you.
